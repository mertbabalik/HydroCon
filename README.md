# HydroCon
IoT-driven hydroponic nutrient control system with fuzzy logic and image-based growth stage classification for Batavia lettuce.

# IoT-Driven Hydroponic Nutrient Control System

This project implements a fully automated nutrient and pH control system for NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) hydroponic farming. It uses an IoT-based architecture to monitor water quality parameters and plant growth, making intelligent dosing decisions based on sensor data and image classification.

## ðŸŒ± Features

- ðŸ“· ESP32-CAM-based image capture and growth stage classification (seedling, vegetative, harvest)
- ðŸ’§ Real-time monitoring of EC, pH, DO, TDS, and water temperature
- ðŸ¤– Fuzzy logic controller for dynamic nutrient and pH dosing
- ðŸ“¡ MQTT communication between ESP32 nodes and Raspberry Pi controller
- ðŸ“Š Growth stage model trained on 4,000+ Batavia lettuce images (HydroGrowNet)

## ðŸ§  System Architecture

- **Sensor Node:** Collects EC, DO, pH, and water temperature readings
- **Dose Node:** Controls 4 nutrient/pH pumps using fuzzy logic decisions
- **Growth Node:** Captures plant images and classifies growth stage
- **Raspberry Pi Controller:** Coordinates MQTT messages and decision logic

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure


## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
